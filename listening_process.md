## 1. What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
- The Feynman Technique is a learning method where you explain a concept in simple words as if teaching a child to reveal gaps in understanding.

## 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- The most interesting idea in the video is how our brain uses two modes to learn: focused mode for deep thinking and diffuse mode for relaxed, creative thinking. Barbara Oakley explains that switching between these modes helps us understand difficult concepts better. Sometimes stepping away from a problem actually makes the solution clearer. This simple idea shows why breaks, sleep, and relaxed thinking are just as important as hard study. It’s a reminder that effective learning is a balance, not nonstop effort.

## 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
- **Active Mode:**
- This is when your brain concentrates intensely on a problem or task. You use full attention, logic, and step-by-step thinking — like solving math problems or debugging code.

- **Diffused Mode:**
- This is a relaxed, open, creative thinking state. Your brain makes broader connections in the background — like getting ideas while walking, showering, or daydreaming.

- Together, they help you learn: focused mode builds understanding, diffuse mode connects ideas and gives insights.

## 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?
- Deconstruct the skill (break it down into smaller sub-skills) 
- Learn just enough to self-correct (get a basic working understanding so you can practise and notice mistakes) 
- Remove practice barriers (eliminate distractions or obstacles that make practising harder) 
- Practice the new skill for at least 20 hours (with regular, deliberate effort)

## 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

- Break big topics into small sub-skills (like SOC tools, Python basics, SQL queries) and learn one at a time.
- Use the Feynman Technique by explaining each concept in simple words to check your understanding.
- Study in focused mode for 25–40 minutes, then switch to diffuse mode by taking short breaks.
- Remove study barriers like notifications, multiple tabs, or background noise during your practice time.
- Practice deliberately for 1–2 hours daily, especially hands-on coding, labs, and scenario-based questions.
- Review and correct mistakes immediately instead of postponing them.
- Use active recall: Quiz myself regularly instead of just rereading notes.
- Apply what you learn through small projects, labs, or mock SOC scenarios.
