# ENERGY MANAGEMENT
### 1. What are the activities you do that make you relax - Calm quadrant?
- My Activities of Calm quadrant
1. Listening to soft music, it immediately slows down my mind and makes me feel lighter.
2. Going for a quiet walk or just sitting outside, fresh air helps me reset.
3. Taking a warm shower, it relaxes my body and clears my head.
4. Lying down and doing nothing for a few minutes, just letting my mind settle.
5. Having tea and scrolling peacefully, simple, but it helps me unwind.

### 2. When do you find getting into the Stress quadrant?
- I usually slip into the Stress quadrant when:
1. I’m learning something new and I can’t understand it quickly — especially technical or coding topics; my mind starts racing.
2. Deadlines are close — even if the task is small, the pressure of “time is running out” stresses me.
3. Too many tasks pile up at once — I feel overwhelmed and don’t know where to start.
4. When I make mistakes repeatedly — I get frustrated with myself, which pushes me into stress mode.
5. Unexpected problems (like errors in code, device issues, or sudden changes in plan) — they throw me off balance and create stress.

### 3. How do you understand if you are in the Excitement quadrant?
- I can tell I’m in the Excitement quadrant when:
1. I feel a sudden boost of energy — like I want to start things immediately without overthinking.
2. My mind feels sharp and focused — ideas come easily, and I’m actually eager to work or learn.
3. I feel curious instead of scared — even if something is challenging, I feel motivated rather than stressed.
4. Time moves fast — I get so absorbed in the task that I don’t realise how much time has passed.
5. I feel proud or confident — there’s a sense of “I can do this” that makes the work enjoyable.

### 4. Paraphrase the Sleep is your Superpower video in your own words in brief. Only the points, no explanation.
1. Sleep is like our body’s life-support system — vital, not optional. 
2. Good sleep helps memory and learning: sleep after learning consolidates new memories; sleep before learning preps your brain to absorb new info. 
3. When you’re sleep-deprived, your brain struggles to store new memories — incoming info “bounces” off instead of getting logged. 
4. Lack of sleep harms immune function — even a single night of poor sleep can reduce activity of “natural-killer” immune cells significantly. 
5. Chronic sleep loss increases risk of serious health issues — cardiovascular disease, metabolic problems, even cancer — and weakens overall physical health. 
6. Poor sleep can accelerate aging, impair brain health, and is linked to long-term cognitive decline. 
7. Deep, high-quality sleep especially (not just any sleep) is crucial — it’s during deep stages that brain and body “restore” and do vital maintenance. 
8. Sleep isn’t a luxury or indulgence — it’s a non-negotiable biological necessity for mental, physical, and emotional well-being.

### 5. What are some ideas that you can implement to sleep better?
- Ideas I Can Implement to Sleep Better

1. Fix a regular sleep and wake-up time.
2. Avoid screens at least 1 hour before bed.
3. Keep my room dark, cool, and quiet.
4. Avoid heavy food, caffeine, or long naps late in the day.
5. Do a simple pre-sleep routine (light stretching, calming music, or reading).
6. Keep my bed only for sleep — not scrolling or studying.
7. Reduce overthinking by writing down next-day tasks before sleeping.

### 6. Paraphrase the video - Brain Changing Benefits of Exercise. Minimum 5 points, only the points.
1. Exercise gives immediate boosts to mood, attention, and focus. 
2. Regular physical activity enhances memory and learning ability long-term. 
3. Exercise structurally changes the brain — increasing growth and repair, promoting new neuron connections (i.e. neuroplasticity / neurogenesis). 
4. It helps protect the brain from degeneration — lowering risk of cognitive decline, dementia or diseases like Alzheimer’s. 
5. Physical activity reduces stress, anxiety, and can improve overall mental health and emotional well-being. 
6. Exercise improves brain efficiency: sharper focus, better executive functioning — helps you think faster and plan or decision-make more clearly. 

### 7. What are some steps you can take to exercise more?
- Steps I Can Take to Exercise More
1. Start with small, doable workouts (10–15 minutes) so it doesn’t feel overwhelming.
2. Fix a specific time of day for exercise, like morning or evening.
3. Choose activities I actually enjoy — walking, dance workouts, yoga, anything.
4. Keep my workout clothes and shoes ready so there’s no friction.
5. Track my workouts to stay motivated (even simple checkmarks).
6. Use short YouTube routines when I don’t have much time.
7. Do movement breaks during long study hours to avoid sitting all day.
